BGP Role for EOS
================

The arista.eos-bgp role creates an abstraction for EOS BGP configuration.
This means that you do not need to write any ansible tasks. Simply create
an object that matches the requirements below and this role will ingest that
object and perform the necessary configuration.

This role specifically enables configuration of BGP router, timers, neighbors,
networks and listeners.

Installation
------------

```
ansible-galaxy install arista.eos-bgp
```


Requirements
------------

Requires an SSH connection for connectivity to your Arista device. You can use
any of the built-in eos connection variables, or the convenience ``provider``
dictionary.

Role Variables
--------------

The tasks in this role are driven by the ``bgp`` and ``eos_purge_bgp_networks``
and ``eos_purge_bgp_neighbors`` objects described below:

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

|                     Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| ----------------------: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| eos_save_running_config | true*, false | Specifies whether to write any changes to the running-config resulting from the role execution to memory, copying the configuration to the startup-config. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Connection Variables
--------------------

Ansible EOS roles require the following connection information to establish
communication with the nodes in your inventory. This information can exist in
the Ansible group_vars or host_vars directories, or in the playbook itself.

|         Key | Required | Choices    | Description                              |
| ----------: | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
|        host | yes      |            | Specifies the DNS host name or address for connecting to the remote device over the specified *transport*. The value of *host* is used as the destination address for the transport. |
|        port | no       |            | Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote device. This value applies to either acceptable value of *transport*. The port value will default to the appropriate transport common port if none is provided in the task (cli=22, http=80, https=443). |
|    username | no       |            | Configures the usename to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device.  The value of *username* is used to authenticate either the CLI login or the eAPI authentication depending on which *transport* is used. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME will be used instead. |
|    password | no       |            | Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This is a common argument used for either acceptable value of *transport*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_PASSWORD will be used instead. |
| ssh_keyfile | no       |            | Specifies the SSH keyfile to use to authenticate the connection to the remote device. This argument is only used when *transport=cli*. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_SSH_KEYFILE will be used instead. |
|   authorize | no       | yes, no*   | Instructs the module to enter priviledged mode on the remote device before sending any commands. If not specified, the device will attempt to excecute all commands in non-priviledged mode. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTHORIZE will be used instead. |
|   auth_pass | no       |            | Specifies the password to use if required to enter privileged mode on the remote device.  If *authorize=no*, then this argument does nothing. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of environment variable ANSIBLE_NET_AUTH_PASS will be used instead. |
|   transport | yes      | cli*, eapi | Configures the transport connection to use when connecting to the remote device. The *transport* argument supports connectivity to the device over cli (ssh) or eapi. |
|     use_ssl | no       | yes*, no   | Configures the transport to use SSL if set to true only when *transport=eapi*.  If *transport=cli*, this value is ignored. |
|    provider | no       |            | Convience method that allows all the above connection arguments to be passed as a dict object. All constraints (required, choices, etc) must be met either by individual arguments or values in this dict. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Ansible Variables
-----------------

|    Key | Choices      | Description                              |
| -----: | ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| no_log | true, false* | Prevents module arguments and output from being logged during the playbook execution. By default, no_log is set to true for tasks that gather and save EOS configuration information to reduce output size. Set to true to prevent all output other than task results. |

```
Note: Asterisk (*) denotes the default value if none specified
```

Dependencies
------------

The eos-bgp role is built on modules included in the core Ansible code.
These modules were added in ansible version 2.1

- Ansible 2.1.0

Example Playbook
----------------

The following example will use the arista.eos-bgp role to setup
a majority of BGP configuration without writing any tasks. We'll create a
``hosts`` file with our switch, then a corresponding ``host_vars`` file and
then a simple playbook which only references the eos-bgp role. By including
the role, we automatically get access to all of the tasks to configure BGP
settings. What's nice about this is that if you have a host without BGP
configuration, the tasks will be skipped without any issue.


Sample hosts file:

    [leafs]
    leaf1.example.com

Sample host_vars/leaf1.example.com

    provider:
      host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      username: admin
      password: admin
      use_ssl: no
      authorize: yes
      transport: cli

    bgp:
      enable: true
      bgp_as: 65001
      maximum_paths: 25
      maximum_ecmp_paths: 100
      redistribute:
        - connected
        - aggregate
      log_neighbor_changes: yes
      timers:
        keep_alive: 0
        hold: 0
      neighbors:
        - name: 10.1.1.1
          remote_as: 65002
          peer_group: demoleaf
          enable: true
        - name: 10.1.1.3
          remote_as: 65002
          peer_group: demoleaf
          enable: true
      listeners:
        - name: 10.1.0.0/16
          peer_group: demoleaf
          remote_as: 65003

    eos_purge_bgp_networks: no
    eos_purge_bgp_neighbors: no


A simple playbook to configure BGP, leaf.yml

    - hosts: leafs
      roles:
         - arista.eos-bgp

Then run with:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts leaf.yml
​
